# asmjlisp
A Lisp compiler/interpreter written in x86-64 assembly

At the time of this writing, the project has thus far just had its own folder in my already functional Lisp interpreter's source code (since I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to follow through with it). For the record, I haven't taken any computer science in college yet, so I'm sorry if there are any inconsistencies or poor quality code. All of this is self-taught.

I had the idea to try doing this by making functions that only call other functions in succession. It turns out that this concept is already a thing, and it's called threaded code. I've expanded on this concept just a little with some of my own ideas, which can be seen in the funcall function, which is intended to interpret the bytecode which is to be generated by the lambda function.

So, the master plan here is to convert Lisp's nested list structure into Forth style reverse polish notation (using stack-oriented assembly functions), and then compile that into bytecode for easy execution.

Another idea for later on (note to self) is the ability to use an embedded Forth-like syntax to do lower-level stuff, or perhaps for slightly better speed.
