# stacklisp
A simple LISP compiler/interpreter for with a stack-based twist

This program translates Lisp's nested list structure into Forth style reverse Polish notation syntax, and then compiles that structure into a simple bytecode for easy interpretation.

At the time of this writing, I am a college freshman going into computer engineering, but I haven't yet taken any computer science classes at my university, so I apologize in advance if sections of the code are amateurish or my terminology is incorrect. All of my knowledge of assembly is self-taught, and this is only my second assembly project.

Nevertheless, this project is under active development and will see many more features in the coming months as I work around my college schedule.
